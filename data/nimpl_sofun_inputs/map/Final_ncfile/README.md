###### The data inlcudes global maps for all prediction fields mapped for site and global simulations: soil carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) (Batjes, 2015), stand-age (age) (Poulter et al., 2018), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) (Pinzon & Tucker, 2014), incident photosynthetic photon flux density averaged over the growing season (gPPFD) (Weedon et al., 2014), growth temperature (Tg) (Harris et al., 2014), vapour pressure deficit (D) (Harris et al., 2014), maximum rate of carboxylation at 25˚C (Vcmax25) (Stocker et al., 2020) and leaf mass-per-area (LMA) (Moreno-Martínez et al. 2018).
