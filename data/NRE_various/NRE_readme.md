#this data (NRE_dataset.csv) is the combination of Du et al. and Deng et al. NRE data.

### Variables
* lon (degree): longtitude 
* lat (degree): latitude 
* MAT: mean annual temperature (recorded in original paper)
* MAP: mean annual precipitation (recorded in original paper)
* Source: source information
* Tg (degree celcius): growth temperature from mapped data
* PPFD (umol/m2/s): average growing-season PPFD from mapped data
* vpd (kPa): vapor-pressure-deficient averaged from growing season from mapped data
* alpha: aet/pet from mapped data
* nhx (nh3 concentration)
* noy (noy concentration)
* ndep: sum of nh3 + noy = nitrogen deposition from ingestr pacakege (gN/m2/yr) (originally Lamarque et al. 2011)
* nre: nitrogen resorption efficiency (unitless)
