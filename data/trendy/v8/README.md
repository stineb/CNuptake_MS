## Simulations

Models can have dynamic vegetation but all will use observed time evolving cropland and grazing (=pasture+rangeland) distribution for S3. The models will be forced over the 1860-2015 period with changing CO2, climate and land use according to the following simulations.

- S0: No forcing change (needed to diagnose any issues / drift)
- S1: CO2 (time-invariant “pre-industrial” land use mask)
- S2: CO2 and climate (time-invariant “pre-industrial” land use mask)
- S3: CO2, climate and land use (Using updated annual LULCC maps to 2015)

## Data processing

Converting monthly to annual data can be done using nice CDO tools. Access an example script [here](https://github.com/stineb/emcon_iav/blob/master/proc_trendy.sh).
